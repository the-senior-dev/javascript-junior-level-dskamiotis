# JavaScript Hoisting Exercise

## Objective

Your task is to understand how hoisting works in JavaScript. The function `calculate` in `src/hoistingExercise.js` should return 12. However, due to hoisting issues, it doesn't work as expected.

## Instructions

1. Open the file `src/hoistingExercise.js`.
2. Your task is to only reorder the statements so that the function returns 12. Do not change any values or operators.
3. Run the tests using `npm test` to check your solution.

## Hints

- Remember, variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
- You should only change the order of the statements to make the function work as expected.

Good luck!
